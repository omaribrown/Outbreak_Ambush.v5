# Outbreak_Ambush.v5
 The Classic Asteroids game meets the Zombie Apocolypse...

## Summary: 
- You've found yourself on the run from zombies. They've chased you into an open field. You're surrounded. You must fight for your survival as long as possible. On the bright side, you have unlimited amunition and 3 lives, and the zombies can't see during the day so they only run in straight lines. 

## How to play:
- use the left/right keys or "a"/"d" keys to rotate left and right
- use the space bar to fire.

## How to Lose:
- Lose a life when a zombie gets close enough to bite you!
- Lose the game when you lose all 3 lives.

## Point System: 
- Each zombie fended off will bank you 15 points. 

## Technologies Used:
- This game is almost entirely based in the P5 Javascript Framework

## Future Improvements: 
- Create a night mode where the contrast makes it more difficult to see zombies and they're a tad bit faster.
- Create a boss zombie that takes multiple hits and moves way faster and towards the player.
- Add artwork for the zombies that face their heading.

## Giving credit: 
### I referenced dozens of articles and editor playgrounds to get an understanding of how I could make this game work. Here are a few places I found extremely helpful:
- The Coding Train Youtube Channel had a ton of helpful videos on the nitty gritty of the P5 framework and taught me about a createVector and P5.Vector.Random2D ... Check him out if you're ever working on a canvas project.

- The P5.JS official website also has a very useful resources tool that gives very good insight on how to use their methods. They, along with others who have used the framework, have left a ton of examples for each and every idea you might have within the canvas structure.
